The app allows you to add calming pictures to your zen garden to help you achieve zen in the midst of everyday chaos.

The App has been constructed using React Native with the following packages: StatusBar from expo-status-bar, useState, 
useEffect, and createContext from react, AsyncStorage from @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, 
createNativeStackNavigator from @react-navigation/native-stack, and StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, Image, TextInput, FlatList, 
ImageBackground, TouchableOpacity, and Linking from react-native.
